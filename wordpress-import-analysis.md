# WordPress Import Analysis & Fixes

## Overview
This document tracks the analysis of WordPress import events and Livewire components, identifying and fixing any broken or incorrect implementations.

## Components to Analyze

### Events
- [ ] Check all events in app/Events/
- [ ] Verify event broadcasting configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper event dispatching

### Livewire Components
- [ ] ImportStatus component
- [ ] Dashboard component
- [ ] Progress component
- [ ] Related Jobs (AnalyzeWordPressMediaJob, ImportMediaItemJob)

### Models & Services
- [ ] WordPressCredential model
- [ ] Import model updates
- [ ] WordPressApiService
- [ ] Broadcasting configuration

## Issues Found

### 1. Event Files - Status: ✅ ANALYZED
- **ImportItemProcessed.php**: Uses `ImportItem` model but this doesn't exist - should be `ImportItem`
- **ImportProgressUpdated.php**: Missing `InteractsWithSockets` trait and `declare(strict_types=1)` inconsistency
- **ImportStatusChanged.php**: All good, properly structured

### 2. Broadcasting Configuration - Status: ✅ ANALYZED
- **broadcasting.php**: Standard Laravel config, properly configured
- **channels.php**: Authorization looks correct for import channels

### 3. Livewire Components - Status: ✅ ANALYZED
- **ImportStatus.php**: Echo listener syntax may be incorrect
- **Dashboard.php**: Very comprehensive but authorization checks may be missing for some actions
- **Progress.php**: Debug logging left in production code

### 4. Model Issues - Status: ✅ ANALYZED
- **WordPressCredential.php**: Missing `encrypted_password` column in fillable array
- **ImportItem model**: Referenced but doesn't exist in codebase

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: ImportProgressUpdated Event Consistency
- Add missing `InteractsWithSockets` trait
- Add missing `declare(strict_types=1)` directive
- Fix return type annotations

### Fix 2: ImportStatus Component Echo Listener
- Fix the echo listener syntax for proper event handling

### Fix 3: WordPressCredential Model
- Add missing `encrypted_password` to fillable array
- Fix attribute accessor pattern

### Fix 4: Progress Component Debug Logging

### Fix 5: Dashboard Component Authorization
- Add proper authorization checks for import actions
- Add AuthorizesRequests trait to Dashboard component

### Fix 6: ImportPolicy Implementation
- Complete ImportPolicy with proper authorization methods
- Add all CRUD operations with user ownership checks
- Add strict type declarations

### Fix 7: Real-time Updates Implementation
- Fixed ImportStatus component to use getListeners() instead of #[On] attributes
- Added fallback polling (10s) for active imports to ensure UI updates
- Added real-time connection status indicator
- Fixed test command event dispatching mismatch

## Summary
